They may kill me,
but they cannot kill my ideas.
They can crush my body, 
but they will not be able to crush my spirit.
- Bhagat Singh
             About Bhagat Singh
Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907, in the village of Banga near Lyallpur district in Punjab,
British India. He was an Indian freedom fighter who is considered to be one of the most influential 
revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. 
Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) at a young age and became
involved in revolutionary activities. He participated in several acts of sabotage against 
British institutions, including an attempt to bomb the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi.
In 1929, he and two other activists were convicted of assassinating John Saunders, 
a British police officer. Singh was executed by hanging on March 23, 1931, 
at Lahore jail at the age of 23. Despite his short life, 
Bhagat Singh left a lasting legacy in the struggle for Indian independence. 
He is revered by many as a martyr and symbol of resistance to British colonialism in India.
His example continues to inspire new generations of activists worldwide.
